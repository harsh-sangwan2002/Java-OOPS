## com.harsh.introduction to OOP

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data in the form of fields (attributes) and code in the form of methods (functions). Java is a widely used programming language that supports OOP principles.

## Classes and Objects

In Java, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. An object is an instance of a class, and it can have its own unique data and behavior. This section covers how to define classes, create objects, and work with class members.

## Inheritance

Inheritance is a key feature of OOP that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. This section explains how inheritance works in Java and demonstrates its use cases.

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their superclass, enabling flexibility and code reuse. This section explores polymorphism through method overriding and method overloading examples.

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class). This section discusses the benefits of encapsulation and how to achieve it in Java.

## Abstraction

Abstraction involves hiding complex implementation details and exposing only essential features to the user. This section showcases abstraction concepts in Java, such as abstract classes and interfaces.

## Examples

The `examples` directory contains practical examples illustrating various OOP concepts in Java. Each example is accompanied by comments and explanations to enhance understanding.
